# The Password Game

I saw this game in some video a few months back which a youtuber used to trick scammer and waste his time by 3 to 4 hours. I tried making it back then but it was really hard to do all of this things and setup the regex to identify it (which is also a thing that I didn't know anything about) Now I gave it another try after making all of this project and seems like it is working. While more work and custom rules needed to be added into this I hope you will like it. 

Some things are fetched with api while some are just written in lib folder. 

Give it a star if you like this :)
